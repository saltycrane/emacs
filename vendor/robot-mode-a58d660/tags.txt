*** Test Cases ***
robot keywords can be found with tags
    a robot kw 
    also try finding a kw given as argument  a robot kw
    and if you select the following: a robot kw ,it should be found

robot keywords with infix arguments can also be searched
    a kw with 'infix' argument
    a kw with a list 'infix' argument

variables used as arguments can be searched using tags
    from normal kw arguments  ${scalar}  @{list}
    and also when the variables '${scalar}' '@{list}' are used in infix position 
    # note that the cursor point needs to be inside the variable when
    # doing this i.e. anywhere from '$' to '}'

variables cannot be completed correctly
    when given as normal arguments (try ESC TAB)  ${scal
    #note the crap
    and in infix position it is even worse

variables set with kws are tagged with tag.sh
    set suite variable  ${suitevar}  abc
    set global variable  @{globalvar}  123
    set test variable  ${testvar}  test
    set funny-kind-of variable  ${funnyvar}  funny
    # M-. on top of above variables should bring you to the same line.
    # The gist of the thing is that tag.sh thinks that everything
    # matching 'set ... variable ${varname}' defines some kind of
    # variable.

variables passed as arguments cannot be found with tags
    [Arguments]  ${arg1}
    doing M-. on '${arg1}' will not work

variables passed as '${tagged-infix}' arguments on the other hand are found
    as we can see by doing M-. on '${tagged-infix}' does work
    # but poorly as the search is not restricted to inside the kw
    # being defined. In other words it works only by accident as what
    # is really being found from the tags is the whole kw.

kw completion 
    a kw with a
    foo

*** Keywords ***
a kw with '${infix}' argument
    comment  should be found

a kw with a list '@{infix}' argument
    comment  should be found

a robot kw
    comment  this should be found

a robot kw found next
    comment  press continue tags finding to get here after finding 'a robot kw'

*** Test Cases ***

variables should have the variable font lock face
    as argument  ${scalar}
    as infix '${scalar}' arguments
    as argument  @{list}
    as infix '@{list}' arguments  

variable assignment uses the variable face
    ${scalar}=  uses the comment face
    @{list}=  uses the comment face

variables can have spaces inside them
    like this  ${var containing spaces}
    but not record separators (double spaces)   ${var  other field}

variable face should not be set if the field in question does not have a closing brace '}'
    run M-x robot-mode
    this should not be colorized  ${novar
    and neither should this following kw
    also here  ${var  is not a variable
    or here in infix form '${var' as you hopefully see
    
comment faces
    comment  as a kw uses the comment face
    #also hash comments use comment face
#hash comments use comment face at top level also

kw calls should not have function face (issue 18)
    first kw

    this should not have function face

it should not matter whether the indendation is done with tabs or space
	this step should not have function face
